A improved, modern version of ModMail for the Transprogrammer community.

Rodhaj is a ModMail bot similar to `ModMail <https://github.com/modmail-dev/modmail>`_,
but with a completely new, improved codebase and features. It works just like Reddit's Modmail,
where users can send messages to the bot and the bot will relay it to the server's staff team. This allows
for a process of communicating from user to staff to be streamlined, and securely done.


What's Different?
-----------------

The major difference with Rodhaj is that tickets are handled through Discord's new Forum channels.
Along with other changes, such as using PostgreSQL over MongoDB, Rodhaj takes the same concepts as ModMail
and improves on them.

Unlike ModMail, this bot is fine-tuned for the needs of the Transprogrammer community.
Thus, **this bot has no invite**.
