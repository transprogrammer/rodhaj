# Rodhaj

A improved, modern version of ModMail for Transprogrammer

## What is Rodhaj?

Just like ModMail, Rodhaj serves to be the transprogrammer's official ModMail bot. By creating a shared inbox, it allows for users and staff to seamlessly communicate safely, securely, and privately.

Unlike ModMail, this bot is fine-tuned for the needs of the transprogrammer community.
